# You're in! Welcome to the Time On Ice Beta 🏒

Thanks for helping me test **Time On Ice**. You are now on the official "Roster" (the whitelist). Please follow these steps **in order**. Beta testing on Android can be a little quirky, so stick to the script!

If you haven't joined yet, click [here](https://forms.gle/wj1Bfc2VrzWvGCy77) or email me at [hello@lr7.digital](mailto:hello@lr7.digital) and I'll add you to the list!

Now if you're in, are you ready? Good cuz 'yer goin!

### Step 1: Accept the Invite (Crucial)
You must "Opt-In" before you can download anything.

1.  Click this specific link: **[https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.TimeOnIce](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.TimeOnIce)**
2.  Make sure you are signed in with the **same Google Account** you gave me.
3.  Click the big blue button that says **"BECOME A TESTER"**.
    * *If you see a "App not available" error, wait 30 minutes and try again. Google sometimes takes time to update the list.*

### Step 2: Install on Your Phone 📱
1.  Once you have become a tester, use this link to go to the Store page:
    * **[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TimeOnIce](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TimeOnIce)**
2.  Install the app on your phone.
3.  **Open it** and grant the necessary permissions.

### Step 3: Install on Your Watch ⌚ (The Important Part)
*The watch app does NOT always install automatically. Do one of the following:*

**Option A: The "Remote Install" (Best Method)**
1.  Open this link on your **Phone or Laptop browser**:
    * **[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TimeOnIce](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TimeOnIce)**
2.  Look for the green **"Install on more devices"** button (or the small arrow next to "Install").
3.  Check the box next to your **Watch name** (e.g., "Galaxy Watch 6").
4.  Click **Install**. It will push the app to your watch within 1-2 minutes.

**Option B: The "On-Watch" Method**
1.  Open the **Play Store app** on your actual watch face.
2.  Scroll down to the category called **"Apps on your phone"**.
3.  Find **Time On Ice** in that list and tap the download icon.

### Step 4: Get "Pro" for Free 💎
1.  Open the app on your **Phone**.
2.  Tap the **Settings (Gear)** icon > **"Unlock Pro"**.
3.  You will see a purchase screen.
    * **CHECK:** It should say **"Test card, always approves"** or show a price of **$0.00 / Free**.
    * *If it asks for real money ($4.99), **STOP**. Do not pay. Let me know at email below.*

### Step 5: Hit the Ice! 🥅
* **Wear your watch** to your next game.
* **Start the app** and **Hit "Start Game"** during warmups or right before face-off.
* **Forget about it.** Let it track your shifts automatically.
