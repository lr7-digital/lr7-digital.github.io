# Privacy Policy for Time On Ice

**Last Updated:** February 3, 2026

**Time On Ice** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect data exclusively through on-device sensors to provide the core functionality of tracking your hockey shifts and performance.

### A. Health & Fitness Data
We access the following data from your device's sensors:
* **Heart Rate:** Used to track your intensity during shifts and calculate recovery.
* **Accelerometer / Activity Data:** Used to detect physical movement (skating vs. sitting) to automatically start and stop shifts.

## 2. Health Connect Data

With your explicit permission, we read and write data to **Health Connect** to sync your hockey workouts with other fitness apps.
* **Data Written:** Completed exercise sessions, including start/stop times, total duration, and heart rate series.

**Limited Use Disclosure:**
The use of information received from Health Connect will adhere to the [Health Connect Permissions policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888170), including the Limited Use requirements.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

* **Real-time Tracking:** Sensor data is processed locally on your watch in real-time to detect game events.
* **Game Analysis:** We calculate statistics like "Total Time on Ice" and "Number of Shifts" to display on your dashboard.
* **Local History:** Your game summaries are stored in a local database on your device so you can view past performance.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

### A. Local Storage
All your personal game history and health metrics are stored locally on your device. We do not maintain external servers, and we do not upload your data to the cloud.

### B. No Third-Party Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal data to outside parties. Data is only shared with the Android **Health Connect** system if you explicitly enable that feature.

## 5. Permissions

To function, the app requires the following permissions:
* `BODY_SENSORS`: To access your heart rate.
* `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`: To detect movement patterns.
* `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`: To ensure tracking continues while the screen is off.

## 6. Data Retention & Deletion

* **User Control:** Since data is stored locally, you have full control. You can delete your entire history by clearing the app's storage in Android Settings or by uninstalling the application.
* **Revoke Permissions:** You can revoke sensor or Health Connect permissions at any time via your device settings.
