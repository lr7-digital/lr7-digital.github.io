# Focus on the game, not your watch.

You paid the league fees. You bought the top-end stick. But do you actually know if you’re getting your ice time? Stop guessing and start tracking.

**Time On Ice** is the ultimate shift tracker built exclusively for hockey players (Wear OS). The app automatically detects when you explode off the bench and when you sit down to catch your breath. It logs every second of your game without you ever needing to fumble with a button or take your gloves off.
